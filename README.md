# DialoGPT, GPT-2, BART/T5, and LangDetect Implementations
## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various AI and NLP models for learning purposes:
- Chatbot using DialoGPT (Microsoft)
- Text generation with GPT-2
- Summarization using BART and T5 models
- Language detection with LangDetect (Google)

> **Note:** These implementations leverage pre-trained libraries and models, and while functional, the results may not always be highly accurate. This project is meant to explore these tools and demonstrate their usage.

## Recommended Environment:
Google Colab is recommended for running the notebooks for better resource management and ease of use.

## Installation
Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Sudham4444/DialoGPT-GPT2-BART_T5-LangDetect.git

## Project Contents
- Chatbot with DialoGPT: Implements a conversational agent using `microsoft/DialoGPT-medium`.
- Text Generation with GPT-2: Generates text from a given prompt using `gpt2`.
- Summarization with BART/T5: Summarizes long text using `t5-small` model.
- Language Detection with LangDetect: Detects the language of a given text using langdetect.

## Usage
Each model can be run by executing the corresponding notebook. This is designed as a learning resource to familiarize with Hugging Face's `transformers` library and NLP concepts.

## Learning Outcomes
- Familiarize with text generation and conversation models like DialoGPT and GPT-2.
- Practice text summarization using BART and T5.
- Explore simple language detection using langdetect.
